[This is a brief tutorial on Tori-Lisp, an ersatz Lisp for little
birds. A passing familiarity with Lisp and Lisp-like languages is
presumed.]

TL programs consist of expressions. The simplest expressions are
things like numbers and strings, which evaluate to themselves.

    鳥>  25
    ;;=> 25

    鳥>  "foo"
    ;;=> 'foo'

There's an important detail about TL that bears mentioning at this
time. That is, the language is hosted on the JavaScript programming
language and thus "bottoms-out" at JavaScript data-types and
structures. Therefore, the TL console will always display its
results as JavaScript types and indeed, the evaluation engine of
the language operates on and with JavaScript types and functions.

TL is like most Lisp-like languages in that the list form
represents a function call:

    鳥>  (+ 1 2)
    ;;=> 3

Since expression and evaluation are both defined recursively, 
programs can be as complex as you want:

    鳥>  (+ (+ 1 2) (+ 3 (+ 4 5)))
    ;;=> 15 

Unlike many Lisps, TL functions always expect a fixed number of 
arguments. For example, the `+` function shown above expects to
receive 2 arguments and if it receives too many then and error
occurs:

    鳥>  (+ 1 2 3)
    ;;=> Error: Too many arguments to function: expected 2, got 3
