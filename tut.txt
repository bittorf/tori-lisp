[This is a brief tutorial on Tori-Lisp, an ersatz Lisp for little
birds. No familiarity with Lisp or Lisp-like languages is
presumed.]

TL programs consist of expressions. The simplest expressions are
things like numbers and strings, which evaluate to themselves.

鳥>  25
;;=> 25

鳥>  "foo"
;;=> 'foo'

There's an important detail about TL that bears mentioning at this
time. That is, the language is hosted on the JavaScript programming
language and thus "bottoms-out" at JavaScript data-types and
structures. Therefore, the TL console will always display its
results as JavaScript types and indeed, the evaluation engine of
the language operates on and with JavaScript types and functions.
