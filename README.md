# ToriLisp

An ersatz LISP for little birds.

An experiment in writing languages in JavaScript.

A code painting.

An alternative to solving jigsaw puzzles.

## Introduction

Run the ToriLisp REPL in a command shell with:

    node repl.js core.lisp

ToriLisp (TL) programs consists of expressions. The simplest expressions 
are things like numbers and strings, which evaluate to themselves.

    鳥> 9
    9
    
    鳥> "quack"
    'quack'

A more extensive walk-through of the language is given in the tut.txt
file in this repository.

## Notes

The seeds of ToriLisp come from Mary Rose Cook's lovely 
[Little Lisp](https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp) and takes
the MIT license from it.
